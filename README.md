## Overview

Starblitz Assault is a high-intensity side-scrolling survival wave shooter where players pilot the advanced Starblitz fighter through hostile alien-infested galaxies.

- Multiple enemy types with unique attack patterns and behaviors
- A spectacular boss battle with multi-phase challenge
- Dynamic backgrounds with parallax scrolling effects
- Progressive difficulty scaling to maintain challenge
- Extensive powerup system with 11 different upgrade types
- A modern pixel art aesthetic with fluid animations

## Feel The Vibes

This entire game was vibe coded — stitched together by instinct, stubbornness, scotch, and a string of late-night hunches. No Gantt charts. No scrum boards.  Just vibes.
