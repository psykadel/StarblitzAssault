# Use the following approach to implement a sound system

- Check to see if a sound system exists in the code
- If the sound system does not exist make it
- Download appropriate open free sounds from the internet using curl
- Use the OGG format for sounds
- Adjust the sound system to use the newly downloaded sounds
- Ensure all sounds are organized and named clearly
- DO NOT GENERATE YOUR OWN SOUNDS
- DO NOT INSTALL NEW SOFTWARE
- THIS IS ONLY SOUNDS NOT MUSIC
