# Commit all

- First look to see what all has changed or been added to the workspace.  Get everything we need to commit
- Commit granular changes writing a nice commit message for each granular change.  Logically group the changes and use multiple commits
- Use git best practices for your descriptions and grouping of changes
- Ensure everything changed, added, or removed is committed
- Just commit do not push
