# Pygame Guidelines

## Sprite Sheets
- Sprite sheets are located in `assets/sprites`
- Sprite sheets are 1024x1024 and arranged in a grid 3x3 grid of identical squares
- Sprite sheets have an alpha channel (transparent background)
- Parse the sprite sheets for the characters and animations!

## Assets
- Store in `assets/`
- Convert assets after loading (`convert()` or `convert_alpha()`)
- Preload assets before the game loop

## File Management
- Use `os.path.join()` for file paths
- Wrap file operations in `try-except`
- Save configurations and states in JSON
