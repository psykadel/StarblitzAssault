1. Read and understand the complete enemy system in this project.  Identify everything about how enemies are implemented. Understand the structure, conventions, and logic patterns.

2. Make a plan how to safely extend the enemy system to include a new enemy.  Make sure it doesn't break anything and follows all existing patterns.

3. Add a new enemy to the system.
Insert a new, fully functional enemy into the game that fits naturally into the existing system but brings novelty.

Your enemy must:

    Introduce a unique behavior or mechanic not already present

    Be integrated into existing structures

    Leverage the sprite sheet or other details mentioned
