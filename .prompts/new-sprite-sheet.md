# For native image generation model.

Create a 1024×1024 pixel sprite sheet consisting of 9 individual sprites arranged in a 3×3 grid. One pixel lines demark the grid.  Each cell in the grid contains a precisely 128×128 pixel sprite, centered in the cell with ample transparent padding so the sprite never touches the tile edges. Use a transparent alpha channel for the background. The subject is designed in the best Super Nintendo–era pixel style: crisp, vibrant, and highly detailed with perfectly square pixels. Animate the sprite smoothly across the 9 frames, changing for a nice animation each tile, and ensure the nose (or key feature) stays in exactly the same position in every frame. Final layout is left to right, top to bottom, for the 9 tiles, all contained in one 1024×1024 image.
