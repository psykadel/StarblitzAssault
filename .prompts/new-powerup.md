**Plan**

1. Read and understand the complete power-up system in this project.  Identify everything about how power-ups are implemented.

2. Make a plan to safely extend the power-up system to include a new power-up. Ensure the plan aligns with all existing patterns, doesn't break or bypass current logic, and cleanly integrates into the existing system.

If the user explains the basics of the powerup to you, use them.  If the user does not explain, use your creativity to decide.

**Execute**

3. Add a new power-up to the system.  Insert a new, fully functional power-up into the game that fits naturally within the existing system but brings a fresh mechanic or strategic twist.

If the user explains the basics of the powerup to you, use them.  If the user does not explain, use your creativity to decide.
